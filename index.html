<h1>Reflections</h1>
<h2>Project One</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>My process was primarily in my head. I try to avoid not writing things down or sketching things out just in case I forget things but I find it's very effective to do these processes in my mind. I can change things without ever moving, creating a design blueprint for myself effortlessly. For this project specifically, I knew I wanted to tie in the ocean due to the tide connection to the moon and very quickly I came up with the idea of having a wave with that seafoam layer as the background. Having stars was a no brainer for me; I incorporate star motifs into most of my work and for this piece, it made even more sense to use them. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted the planet in the middle to look like or where I wanted the words to go. I knew those aspects were something I'd have to tinker with as I went because they needed to look good against the background and while I'm a good visualizer, I can't know what the finished product will truly look like. My process for creating has always been quite intuitive. I find it hard to create if I plan too much or create too many sketches, it boxes me into one idea. That's why I didn't think too hard about what the planet and wording would end up looking like because I knew I wouldn't want to be sold on one idea that may not work.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>I think the biggest flaw in this work is that doesn't create a very simplified logo to stand on its own. One of my pet peeves about logo design is when there isn't a version of the logo that has a transparent background. It's not necessary, but making merch is a lot harder when you don't have a logo that can stand on it's own without a background. I think if the background were simply removed from this logo it could be workable but I should have made a version with no background intentionally. I also think the wording is a bit hard to read while in an arc so I probably should have chose a font that would work better in an arc.</p>

<h2>Project Two</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>My idea for my two images stemmed from the idea of Narnia and Fillory in The Magicians, of magical worlds that exist alongside ours but experience time separately. I wasn't sure what I'd do with this idea, I just knew it was a good starting point for me. I then went to Googles Arts & Culture resource and found art that I felt might work with my idea. Creating both images was a really intuitive process. I treated it similarly to how I create illustrations, I messed around and just tried a lot of things. I tried to make the colors in both image fairly cohesive which I think I did successfully. There's not much thought behind the elements of my piece, it's all just fueled by intuition and feeling. I didn't add things with the intricate thought of meaning or representation, I added things based on what emotions I felt they'd evoke.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>In my opinion the biggest flaw in these two pieces is in the first image. The flowers in the glass sphere in the background feel pretty out of place. I was going for something a bit fantastical in its nonsense but I'm not sure that really hit the mark and I don't feel great about them being there.</p>
