<H1>Final Portfolio</H1>

<h2>Project One</h2>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>For this project I made a header and an icon. My main focus here was keeping a space theme while also giving homage to the fact that Southworth Planetarium is in Portland. To do this, I added a beach and a wave to the background. While the wave is a nod to Portland, it's also a nod to the fact that the tides are affected by the moon. While waves are not the same thing as the tide, many people think of waves when they think of the tides. I believe this is a fun way to tie the location of the Planetarium to astronomy. For colors, I kept to a very blue theme. We often associate blue with the ocean so that's why I chose to keep the theme fairly blue-leaning across the board to maintain that nod to Portland as a coastal city. The font I used is called New Romantics. I chose this font because it's one of my favorites and the I's are dotted with stars instead of dots, which I felt was a nice tie-in. The font is not the most readable when used in a small format (such as on social media on a phone screen) but due to usernames, I'm not quite worried about that. In a bigger format, such as on a poster, it would be fairly readable and that's when you really want it to be, so I'm not overly worried about that.</p>

<h2>Project Two</h2>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>My project is based around the idea of going to a fantasy world and how time interacts with that space. My first image explores the idea of entering a fantastical world and setting off to explore it, blissfully unaware of the inherent horror of having a whole journey only to return to a world where no time has passed. These characters go through whole experiences, sometimes even whole lives, only to return to a body and world where they are younger than they were moments ago, where none of what they've experienced is meaningfully real to the rest of the world. While we often see the fantastical side of this idea, my second image really explores the horror of it all. To lose so much time without time ever truly passing is something that is terrifying, it can represent a complete loss of identity and sense of reality. Past the way this idea is represented in fantasy, it's also quite real. Maladaptive daydreaming and dissociative amnesia can create a very similar experience and feeling. I wanted to represent this idea primarily because I identify with it as someone with dissociative amnesia. Though I don't experience this to a distressing degree, I still feel how unsettling it can and could be, and that was important for me to represent.</p>
<p>When it comes to technique I chose to use primarily art from googles arts & culture resource. I did a lot of layering on top of the finished images to blend the colors together and really try to create images that looked cohesive. Having a digital illustration background made this a lot easier because I had a pretty solid understanding of what layer options do already. It was important to me that I try my best to do a little bit more than just putting the images together. I really wanted to make use of my existing skills. I could have even used my display tablet but I figured I'd get too absorbed in the details so that was a limit I put on myself.</p>

<h2>Project Three</h2>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>This is my project, Life Between The Horrors. The idea behind this project is to be a snippet of how my life has felt this year. Everything is so horrible, the country is falling apart and I watch as friends live in exceedingly dangerous spaces while I can do nothing to help them, but I have to keep living. Work, school, life in general, nothing stops simply because it feels like everything should. Life doesn't feel right. There are moments, snippets of joy, but they're quieter than before.</p>

<p>Past this being a representation of the effects of living through facism, it's also a reflection of both the past few months and the future. The video ends on a clip of a busy street in New York City, a choice I made intentionally due to the fact that next year, I'm moving to NYC. I barely sleep, overworking myself so I can afford to move, but there's so much hope in that. I know I'll be happier there, that it'll all be worth it. I may not have the same joy I did before this year, but I have more hope and that's something. Life moves forward, so I might as well hope for the future even when it feels like there won't be one. This video is a representation of that; of continuing forward, of hoping for the future, even when the world makes it feel like the only option is to stand still and wait for the storm to pass. Waiting is giving up. I won't put my life on hold because that is the death of hope and progress.</p>

<p>When it comes to techniques, I didn't do anything particularly unique or special with the editing of this project. I didn't do transitions between clips; I felt the hard cuts worked well for this project. Most of the technique with this project was just collecting a lot of clips I thought could work, arranging clips, and then culling any clips I felt didn't fit. I didn't tweak the audio much either. I enhanced one of the voice clips, adjusted volume at points, and did a fade out at the end but that's all quite simple. I tried to align clips with notable parts of the music, which I think worked well, but otherwise didn't do too much with the music. I found the choice to include voice clips to work very well, and I ended up quite liking the music I used. Overall, it may not have been the most complex editing job in the world, but its simplicity serves it well in my opinion.</p>
