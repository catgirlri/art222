<h2>Project One</h2>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>For this project I made a header and an icon. My main focus here was keeping a space theme while also giving homage to the fact that Southworth Planetarium is in Portland. To do this, I added a beach and a wave to the background. While the wave is a nod to Portland, it's also a nod to the fact that the tides are affected by the moon. While waves are not the same thing as the tide, many people think of waves when they think of the tides. I believe this is a fun way to tie the location of the Planetarium to astronomy. For colors, I kept to a very blue theme. We often associate blue with the ocean so that's why I chose to keep the theme fairly blue-leaning across the board to maintain that nod to Portland as a coastal city. The font I used is called New Romantics. I chose this font because it's one of my favorites and the I's are dotted with stars instead of dots, which I felt was a nice tie-in. The font is not the most readable when used in a small format (such as on social media on a phone screen) but due to usernames, I'm not quite worried about that. In a bigger format, such as on a poster, it would be fairly readable and that's when you really want it to be, so I'm not overly worried about that.</p>
