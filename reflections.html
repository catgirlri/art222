<h1>Reflections</h1>
<h2>Project One</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>My process was primarily in my head. I try to avoid not writing things down or sketching things out just in case I forget things but I find it's very effective to do these processes in my mind. I can change things without ever moving, creating a design blueprint for myself effortlessly. For this project specifically, I knew I wanted to tie in the ocean due to the tide connection to the moon and very quickly I came up with the idea of having a wave with that seafoam layer as the background. Having stars was a no brainer for me; I incorporate star motifs into most of my work and for this piece, it made even more sense to use them. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted the planet in the middle to look like or where I wanted the words to go. I knew those aspects were something I'd have to tinker with as I went because they needed to look good against the background and while I'm a good visualizer, I can't know what the finished product will truly look like. My process for creating has always been quite intuitive. I find it hard to create if I plan too much or create too many sketches, it boxes me into one idea. That's why I didn't think too hard about what the planet and wording would end up looking like because I knew I wouldn't want to be sold on one idea that may not work.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>I think the biggest flaw in this work is that doesn't create a very simplified logo to stand on its own. One of my pet peeves about logo design is when there isn't a version of the logo that has a transparent background. It's not necessary, but making merch is a lot harder when you don't have a logo that can stand on it's own without a background. I think if the background were simply removed from this logo it could be workable but I should have made a version with no background intentionally. I also think the wording is a bit hard to read while in an arc so I probably should have chose a font that would work better in an arc.</p>

<h2>Project Two</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>My idea for my two images stemmed from the idea of Narnia and Fillory in The Magicians, of magical worlds that exist alongside ours but experience time separately. I wasn't sure what I'd do with this idea, I just knew it was a good starting point for me. I then went to Googles Arts & Culture resource and found art that I felt might work with my idea. Creating both images was a really intuitive process. I treated it similarly to how I create illustrations, I messed around and just tried a lot of things. I tried to make the colors in both image fairly cohesive which I think I did successfully. There's not much thought behind the elements of my piece, it's all just fueled by intuition and feeling. I didn't add things with the intricate thought of meaning or representation, I added things based on what emotions I felt they'd evoke.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>In my opinion the biggest flaw in these two pieces is in the first image. The flowers in the glass sphere in the background feel pretty out of place. I was going for something a bit fantastical in its nonsense but I'm not sure that really hit the mark and I don't feel great about them being there.</p>

<h2>Project Three</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>As a former editor, the process of gathering clips & cutting what I wanted from them to ultimately make a cohesive project was very comfortable for me to do, even in a new program. I didn't have a strong idea of what I wanted to do past doing a sort of reflective piece about my own life so I scrubbed through clips and downloaded every single video that caught my eye in some way. I then put everything into the project, cut small snippets I liked, and discarded most of what was originally imported into the project. As I went through the clips I realized I wanted to do something that was a mix of all of the pretty awful things that have been happening to and around me recently, contrasting that with little bits of joy and hope. There's also an air of apathy that I wanted to capture, that feeling of "Well, everything is awful so why care about anything at all?" and I think with the clips I chose I did that pretty well. I think the go with the flow style of editing truly is so ideal for editing clips together, it's the style of editing I've always used when doing this sort of edit, because editing clips together like this is about exploring the videos you have to find clips that could really shine in different contexts. You just can't plan that and trying to plan that is detrimental. If I had a strong idea of what I wanted for this project, I wouldn't have been able to create it at all. You have to be able to let go of control and having a strong idea of exactly you want is detrimental to that.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>I think the audio mixing could have been better in the speaking clip in the middle of the video. I also think the blue clip of the man drinking(?) runs a bit long. The audio at the end also repeats and you can hear it repeat. I could have made it a smooth transition and didn't but I should have.</p>

<h2>Project Four</h2>

<h3>Question & Explain</h3>
<p>My process was quite simple for this project. I wanted something that wouldn't make me cry trying to make it, I had pears in my fridge, and so I chose to make a pear. Blender is a stressful and confusing program and I think with this project simplicity truly was key for me personally. I've never been great at 3d as a medium. Something about it really doesn't compute in my brain. I've never been good at visualizing 3d creations in my mind and that's something that is so vital to my creation process with 2d media that I don't know what to do without that ability. I can visualize very basic things but not complex or stylized creations. Visualizing 2d media has always been so natural to me, the fact that I struggle with visualizing 3d media is really frustrating for me. With this project in particular, I think I did fairly well managing that but I don't think I could have done something very stylized without a lot of struggle.</p>

<h3>Evaluate</h3>
<p>It's not a good pear. It's a pear somewhat identifiably, asian pears do look a bit like apples, and that's good but it's also very basic. There's not a lot going on there. The surfaces are also very one dimensional, theres no texture to the materials/skin of the meshes. The best evaluation of this piece is truly that its a pear and thats really it.</p>
